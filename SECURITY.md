# Security Policy

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a potential vulnerability in this project, please follow the
instructions below to report it responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Preferred reporting methods:

- Use GitHub's private Security Advisories for this repository (recommended).
- If that is not possible, open an issue titled "SECURITY - [short summary]" and add the label `security`, or
- Email the repository maintainer(s). If no direct email is listed, open a private GitHub issue or use the project's
  default contact method.

When reporting, provide:

- A short, clear summary of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce (minimal reproducible example if possible).
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior.
- Affected versions (commit hash, release tag or branch).
- Any logs, screenshots, or PoC code (avoid publishing exploit details publicly).

Example report template:

- Title: SECURITY - [brief description]
- Affected version/commit:
- Description:
- Steps to reproduce:
- Impact:
- Suggested mitigation (optional):
- Contact (how we can reach you if follow-up is needed):

Do not post exploit details or PoC publicly until the issue is resolved.

## Response Process

- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- We aim to provide a timeline for triage and fixes as soon as possible.
- After a fix is available, we will coordinate a public disclosure (advisory or release notes) and credit the reporter
  if desired.

## Supported Versions

- Security fixes will be backported to actively maintained branches. If you are unsure which versions are maintained,
  open an issue or ask in the repo.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please allow maintainers reasonable time to address the issue before making details public. If you need to escalate or
do not receive a response, you may:

- Open a public issue (without exploit details), or
- Contact the repository owner via alternative contact information if available.

## Emergency

If the issue is critical and requires immediate attention (e.g., active exploitation), mark it clearly in your report
and provide full reproduction steps so it can be triaged urgently.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
